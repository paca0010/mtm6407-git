    <h2>What You’ll Learn</h2>
    <p>Have you ever stared at your furniture and wondered if your chair resents you for sitting on it? Or if your phone sighs every time you drop it? In this episode, we deep-dive into the ridiculous but strangely deep thoughts that hit when you least expect them.</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Does My Phone Judge Me?</strong> – If it had a personality, would it roll its eyes every time I reopen Instagram?</li>

      <p>Picture this: you’re in the shower, minding your own business, when suddenly—bam! A thought hits you out of nowhere. "Do my pillows hate each other?" And just like that, you’re spiraling. You start wondering if your favorite hoodie feels special or if your old backpack holds grudges for being replaced. The rabbit hole is deep, and once you’re in, there’s no going back.</p>

      <p>It’s weird how our brains assign emotions to things that can’t think. But if a toy in *Toy Story* dies, do the other toys just keep playing with its corpse? If I press the elevator button multiple times, does it get annoyed? And don’t even get me started on how I sometimes apologize to my furniture when I bump into it—like, what’s that about?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Maybe it’s just our brains finding entertainment in the mundane. Or maybe, deep down, we just want to believe the things around us have stories, too. Either way, if you’ve ever felt guilty about abandoning an old stuffed animal or worried that your gaming console is plotting revenge for all those rage quits—congrats, you’re not alone. Welcome to the club of unnecessary existential crises.</p>
