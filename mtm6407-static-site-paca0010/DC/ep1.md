    <h2>What Went Down</h2>
    <p>Look, I just wanted a burrito. That’s it. A simple, innocent, cheesy, perfectly wrapped masterpiece. But apparently, the universe had other plans.</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The craving</strong> – It all started when I was starving and had one mission: get the best burrito in town.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The misunderstanding</strong> – One thing led to another, and suddenly, I found myself explaining to a cop why I was running down the street with someone else’s food.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The escape</strong> – Spoiler alert: I didn’t steal it, but convincing everyone else was the real challenge.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>So there I was, standing outside the burrito place, waiting for my order. I was already on edge because they were taking forever, and my stomach was practically crying. Then, out of nowhere, a guy picks up a burrito from the counter and just dips. No checking the receipt, no hesitation—just straight-up confidence.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Now, me being me, I assumed they had called my name wrong. So I grabbed the next burrito, nodded at the cashier like, ‘yeah, that’s mine,’ and walked out. Next thing I know, some dude is yelling, ‘Hey, that’s mine!’ and before I could explain, he’s calling security. Cue the most unnecessary chase scene ever.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Long story short, after way too much running for a meal I hadn’t even taken a bite of, I managed to clear things up. Turns out, my order was still inside, untouched and waiting. The real criminal? Still at large. And me? Just a guy with a burrito and an almost-arrest record.</p>
