    <h2>What Went Down</h2>
    <p>It all started on a regular morning when I was just trying to get my coffee fix. Little did I know, a simple mix-up would lead to me making coffee for an entire cafe.</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The mix-up</strong> – I walked into my favorite café and stood at the counter, ready to order, when suddenly the barista gestured for me to come behind the counter. He handed me an apron and said, "We’re short today. You in?"</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The chaos</strong> – Without thinking, I agreed. What could go wrong, right? The next thing I knew, I was making espresso shots like my life depended on it while pretending to know how to steam milk.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The aftermath</strong> – Spoiler alert: not everyone loved the coffee. But hey, no one died, and the real barista returned, so I escaped before being branded a menace to coffee lovers everywhere.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>It all started innocently enough. I walked into the café like I always do, excited for my regular order of a cappuccino. But instead of the usual friendly smile from the barista, he looked at me with a sort of panic in his eyes. It seemed like something was off, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Before I could ask, he handed me an apron and pointed to the register. He quickly said, "We’re a bit short today. Can you help us out?" And I, not one to back down from a challenge (or coffee), shrugged and said, "Sure, I can do that!" Famous last words.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>I thought I’d just help out by maybe handing people their drinks. But as soon as I was behind the counter, everything went downhill. The espresso machine looked like something out of a sci-fi movie, and I wasn’t sure if it was going to give me coffee or electrocute me. I fumbled with the buttons and steam, trying not to look completely lost. At some point, I think I even put an order on the wrong tray, and I had to explain to a very confused customer that I wasn’t the barista they were expecting.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Fast forward an hour, and I was fully immersed in the chaos of coffee-making. I was accidentally frothing milk like I was trying to make a bubble bath and brewing espresso so strong it could’ve powered a rocket ship. But somehow, people kept coming back for more, even though I’m pretty sure I didn’t make a single perfect cup. At one point, I even had to Google how to make a flat white. I mean, who knew coffee could be this stressful?</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Eventually, the real barista showed up, and I was able to hand over the reins. I left the café that day feeling a mix of relief and admiration for the people who actually know what they’re doing behind the counter. I’ll never look at my cappuccino the same way again. And, let’s just say, I’ve definitely earned my spot as a customer and not an accidental barista.</p>
