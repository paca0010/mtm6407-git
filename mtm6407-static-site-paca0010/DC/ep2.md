    <h2>What Went Down</h2>
    <p>All I wanted was a coffee. A simple, non-drama-filled caffeine fix. But of course, my life doesn’t work that way.</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The mix-up</strong> – I grabbed a drink that looked exactly like mine. Turns out, it wasn’t.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The realization</strong> – The moment I saw people whispering and glancing my way, I knew something was off.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The aftermath</strong> – Let’s just say, getting mistaken for a coffee thief in front of cameras isn’t a fun experience.</li>
    </ul>

      <p>So there I was, standing outside the burrito place, waiting for my order. I was already on edge because they were taking forever, and my stomach was practically crying. The smell of fresh tortillas and sizzling meat was pure torture at that point. Then, out of nowhere, a guy picks up a burrito from the counter and just dips. No checking the receipt, no hesitation—just straight-up confidence, like he owned the place.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Now, me being me, I assumed they had called my name wrong. So I grabbed the next burrito, nodded at the cashier like, ‘yeah, that’s mine,’ and walked out. I had already taken a step outside when I heard it—the dreaded ‘Hey, that’s mine!’ And before I could even process the situation, the guy was already on the phone, calling security like I had just committed the heist of the century. Cue the most unnecessary chase scene ever, complete with me running through the streets with a burrito I wasn’t even sure was mine.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Long story short, after way too much running (which, let’s be honest, is never ideal on an empty stomach), I managed to clear things up. Turns out, my order was still inside, untouched and waiting, while I had been out here playing fugitive. The real criminal? Still at large, probably enjoying his stolen meal. And me? Just a guy with a burrito, a ridiculous story, and a newfound respect for double-checking his order before walking out.</p>
