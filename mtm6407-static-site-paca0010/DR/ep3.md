    <h2>The Uselessness of Small Talk</h2>
    <p>Why are we still doing this? Small talk—the greatest social illusion of all time. It’s like we all agree to pretend we’re interested in talking about the weather, the traffic, or how tired we are, when we all know that’s just a waste of breath.</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The Weather Rant</strong> – "Isn't it cold today?" Yeah, and it’s going to be cold tomorrow too. We’ve all been there, but we keep doing it.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The “How’s It Going?” Question</strong> – We don’t care, you don’t care. Let’s stop asking and pretending it’s a meaningful exchange.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>The Social Performance</strong> – Why are we acting like this is how conversations are supposed to go? Are we really that invested in avoiding silence?</li>
    </ul>

      <p>Look, small talk has been around since forever, but honestly, I don’t get it. You don’t want to hear about how my day’s been, and I definitely don’t care how your weekend was. So why are we wasting our time? We all know how the conversation goes: “Hey, how’s it going?” “Good, and you?” “Good. The weather’s nice today.” And there we are, stuck in the loop.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>It’s like we’re playing this social game where no one wants to get to the “real” conversation, because—God forbid—we’re all too scared to just say, “Hey, what’s really going on?” So instead, we go for the easy route, sticking with the weather, or “busy at work, huh?” when we both know that’s just a filler sentence.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>And let’s talk about the weather. For some reason, that’s the go-to. But here’s the thing: the weather’s always either too hot, too cold, or just right. How much more can we say about it? Nothing. Yet somehow, this has become the foundation of every awkward first meeting or forced conversation in every waiting room.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>In the end, I’m convinced small talk is just a social crutch. People don’t want to be alone with their thoughts, so they fill the silence with random comments that don’t mean anything. It’s time we start skipping all that nonsense and just talk like actual human beings. Or, you know, stop pretending to be interested in the 75th conversation about the temperature.</p>
