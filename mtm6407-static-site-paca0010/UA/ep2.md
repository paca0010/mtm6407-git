    <h2>What You’ll Learn</h2>
    <p>Ghosting: the unofficial Olympic sport of modern dating and friendships. In this episode, we dissect why it happens, how to deal with it, and whether or not you should be the ghoster or the ghostee.</p>

      <p>Let’s be real—ghosting is brutal, but it’s also a fact of life. Maybe they lost interest, maybe they forgot, or maybe they just got hit by a bus (unlikely, but we can hope). Either way, if someone disappears from your messages like Houdini, you need to know how to handle it. And let’s be honest, we’ve all been on both sides of it at some point. One day you're the ghostee, staring at an empty chat bubble, and the next, you're the ghoster, avoiding a text like it's a work email on a Sunday.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>The key is not to take it personally (even though it absolutely feels personal). If someone doesn’t respect you enough to communicate, they’ve just saved you time. Think of it as a life upgrade: one less person to worry about. On the flip side, if YOU are the ghoster, at least be classy about it—no slow fades, breadcrumbing, or fake excuses like "I lost my phone" (we all know you're lying). If you must vanish, do it cleanly. No messy trails, no unanswered goodbyes—just a swift, silent exit, like a professional.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>So, whether you're the ghosted or the ghoster, the rule remains the same: keep your dignity, don’t double-text, and remember—life goes on. The world is full of people who WILL text back. And if the ghoster ever comes crawling back weeks later with a weak “Hey, how’ve you been?” text, don’t fall for it. Respond with the ultimate power move: absolute silence. Now THAT’S ghosting done right.</p>
