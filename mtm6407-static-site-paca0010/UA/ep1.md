    <h2>What You’ll Learn</h2>
    <p>Let’s be real—failure is inevitable, so you might as well be good at it. In this episode, we break down the fine art of screwing up and making it work in your favor.</p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Step 1: Own the Disaster</strong> – Denial is for amateurs. The faster you admit you messed up, the quicker you can turn it around.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Step 2: Find the Comedy</strong> – If you can’t fix it, at least make it funny. Self-awareness is your best defense.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Step 3: Fail Upwards</strong> – Every L is a lesson if you play it right. We’re turning losses into character development.</li>

  <p>We’ve all been there—whether it’s sending a risky text, bombing a job interview, or confidently walking into the wrong classroom (twice). Failure isn’t just a possibility; it’s a guarantee. But instead of running from it, what if we leaned in? What if instead of pretending we have it all together, we just admitted that life is one giant trial-and-error experiment—mostly error?</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>The trick isn’t to avoid failure—it’s to make sure you fail with style. Did you embarrass yourself in public? Perfect. Now you’ve got a story. Did your brilliant idea flop? Congrats, you just found one way NOT to do it. Some of the most successful people have failed harder than anyone—they just didn’t stop there. They took those Ls, flipped them into lessons, and somehow made it look intentional. That’s the real flex.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>At the end of the day, life is just a series of faceplants with occasional wins in between. No one really knows what they’re doing; some people are just better at faking it. So if you’re out here making questionable decisions, congratulations—you’re officially part of the human experience. The goal? Learn from it, laugh at it, and then use it as content. Because if you’re going to crash and burn, you might as well get some engagement out of it.</p>
